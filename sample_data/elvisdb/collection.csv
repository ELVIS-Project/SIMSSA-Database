Tinctoris's Favorites,"This is a non-exhaustive collection of pieces written between 1435 and 1477 by any of the eight composers that Tinctoris specifically named as great in the prologue to the **Liber de arte contrapuncti**. The date range was chosen because of Tinctoris's famous comment that no music written more than forty years ago (that is, before about 1477) is considered worthy of performance by the learned. The eight composers he names are as follows: 1. Okeghem 2. Regis 3. Busnois 4. Caron 5. Faugues 6. Dunstaple 7. Binchois 8. Du Fay"
