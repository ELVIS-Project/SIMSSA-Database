"""Defines all the models used in the database application

The models are:

* Archive - A location where Sources and Collections of Sources are stored
* AudioFile - A manifestation of a Source as an digital audio file
* CollectionOfSources - A reference to one or more Sources grouped together
* Contribution - Relates a Person that contributed to a work/section/part
* CustomBaseModel - Base model that contains common fields for other models
* Encoder - A User or Software that encoded a file using a workflow
* EncoderValidatorBaseModel - A base model for Encoder and Validator
* ExperimentalStudy - A study based on Files from a particular Research Corpus
* ExtractedFeature - Content-based data extracted from a file
* FeatureType - A category of Feature of which ExtractedFeatures are instances
* File - Base abstract model with fields common to all file types
* GenreAsInStyle - A musical genre (type of work or style)
* GeographicArea - A geographic area that can be part of another are
* ImageFile - A manifestation of a Source as digital images
* Institution - A real world institution (usually academic)
* Instrument - An instrument or voice
* MusicalWork - A complete work of music
* Part - A single voice or instrument in a Section of a Musical Work
* Person - A real world person that contributed to a musical work
* ResearchCorpus - A collection of files that can be used in a ExperimentStudy
* Section - A component of a Musical Work e.g. an Aria in an Opera
* Software - A Software that encoded, validated or extracted features files
* Source - A document containing the music of a Musical Work/Section/Part
* SourceInstantiation - An abstract entity defined by the music in a Source
* SymbolicMusicFile - A manifestation of a Source as a symbolic music file
* TextFile - A manifestation of a Source as a digital Text file
* Validator - A User or Software that verified the quality of files
